# HBSExample
Handlebars variable does not fully display string as a HTML text box's value

This example was originally created for the problem described above.  However
after playing around with it more, I discovered I did not have the HBS variable
in quotes ...value={{this.name}} to this which works ...value="{{this.name}}"
